# Node-Tracker
A Node/Javascript based torrent tracker that I wrote. This is UNTESTED and for the time being will remain as such. It uses an SQL backend for storage. It caches and groups requests for extra speed. This is not complete, but development has ceased for the time being. I plan in the future adding many more cool features and, of course, ensuring that it even works to begin with. 

Some ideas I have:

- Connect to other trackers if this tracker can't serve the request.
- Improve speed
