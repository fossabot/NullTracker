# Node-Tracker
A Node/Javascript based torrent tracker that I wrote. This is UNTESTED and for the time being will remain as such. It uses an SQL backend for storage. It caches and groups requests for extra speed. This is not complete, but development has ceased for the time being. I plan in the future adding many more cool features and, of course, ensuring that it even works to begin with. 

Some ideas I have:

- Connect to other trackers if this tracker can't serve the request. This can be done by manually adding trackers to a list, or scraping sites for trackers and testing them. I'm not sure if I would just randomly pick a tracker to ask for or try multiple and combine them. This tracker may just turn into a proxy if I do that though.
- Improve speed
